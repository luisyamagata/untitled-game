# lore

It's a prequel fan-game for Fallout: New Vegas. You play as the Player Character from Fallout: New Vegas doing deliveries. You get a bike somehow, maybe in an abandoned factory, or some genius re-invents it. After the events of my game the bike will be lost forever an no-one will ever talk about it afterwards. That way it'll be lore friendly.

I think that it could be in-city deliveries. Maybe 3 or 4 major cities/settlements. From different factions. Our Courier has no allegiance. Something for local businesses or for people that want to buy from caravans and aren't able to leave their homes.

My game will literally end where Fallout: New Vegas begins. I have to decide what perspective it's gonna be made in (2D/3D/Isometric). And learn how to make the art for the assets. I'm not much of a designer.

(cancel that) The main character lives in a cyberpunk Rio de Janeiro, on 2125. They need to make some money in a short amount of time. They decide to make deliveries using a bike. The tech is fallout-ish

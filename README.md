# untitled-game - a Fallout: New Vegas Fangame
A repostiory for a game for the itch.io - Accountability Jam: October 2025

# game concept
You need to make some money fast. You have a Bicycle. There is a courier/delivery service on your city that takes almost anyone. You do deliveries and get involved in a conspiracy/corruption plot in your city.

# game genre
Action/Adventure/Life Sim

# language / engine to be used
Godot or Python

# functional requisites

the player gets deliveries to do. And does them. Gets rewarded in money and experience. They're able to level up and buy better equipment that gives stats and/or skill boosts

There will be something similar to the SPECIAL system, maybe with less attributes. And skills also. The character can learn special moves on the bike by attaining certain benchmarks (e.g.: Level 5, or 7 Agility or 50 Bike-Riding). 

There will be mini side-quests to keep things interesting and give the game a semblance of a plot. They'll be optional. If you wanna do just deliveries forever you can (is this hard?, maybe an optional endless mode after the JAM game is done)

# non-functional requisites

# lore

It's a prequel fan-game for Fallout: New Vegas. You play as the Player Character from Fallout: New Vegas doing deliveries. You get a bike somehow, maybe in an abandoned factory, or some genius re-invents it. After the events of my game the bike will be lost forever an no-one will ever talk about it afterwards. That way it'll be lore friendly.

I think that it could be in-city deliveries. Maybe 3 or 4 major cities/settlements. From different factions. Our Courier has no allegiance. Something for local businesses or for people that want to buy from caravans and aren't able to leave their homes.

My game will literally end where Fallout: New Vegas begins. I have to decide what perspective it's gonna be made in (2D/3D/Isometric). And learn how to make the art for the assets. I'm not much of a designer.

(cancel that) The main character lives in a cyberpunk Rio de Janeiro, on 2125. They need to make some money in a short amount of time. They decide to make deliveries using a bike. The tech is fallout-ish

# Additional Info about the main character. (source: [fallout.wiki](https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Courier)):



Nickname: Courier Six

Occupation: Mojave Express

Role:     Player character
          Package courier

Gender: Player's choice

Played By: Laura Bailey (female)
           Yuri Lowenthal (male)

Appears: Fallout: New Vegas


Background

Before taking contract to deliver the Platinum Chip, the Courier had traveled across the former American Southwest, on the Long 15 to Primm, to Circle Junction, New Reno, Vault City, Fort Abandon and on Brahmin drives at the Big Circle.[1][2] They were also hired to deliver a package to a community near Death Valley, the technology contained within the package resulting in underground nuclear detonations after their departure, creating a hostile area known as the Divide.[3][4]

The Courier was one of six messengers hired by the Mojave Express at Mr. House's behest to deliver packages to the New Vegas Strip.[5][6] The Courier was carrying the only item of worth, House's Platinum Chip.[7] In order to steal the chip, Mr. House's protégé Benny intercepted the Courier, shot them in the head twice, and buried them in the Goodsprings Cemetery.[8][9][10][11] The Courier was dug out of their grave by Victor, a Securitron under Mr. House's control.[12] They were operated on by Doc Mitchell, the resident doctor of Goodsprings, who then monitored the Courier's recovery over the following days.[13][14]
Dialogue

The player character can make several statements about their past through in-game dialogue options. They do not form part of their background until they have been selected. Below is a list of elements of the character's past which can be learned through gameplay.
Information

    During a conversation with Bruce Isaac in Novac, the Courier can state that they have been to New Reno and attended one of his shows at the Shark Club.[15]
    When talking with Little Buster, the Courier states they worked as a bounty hunter.[16]
    Before setting off to New Canaan, the Courier can tell Jed Masterson that they have not been to Utah in some time.[17]
    In Honest Hearts, after passing a speech check, a Dead Horse Stalker comments on the Courier's knowledge of the Dead Horses' and the Sorrows' languages.[18]
    A skilled Courier may have a high understanding of RobCo technology. In Honest Hearts, a Courier with a high Science skill can call out Ricky's incompetence with his locked Pip-Boy.[19] In Old World Blues, the Courier can recognize the RobCo signals that Doctor 8 transmits.[20] The Courier is also able to understand ED-E's incomprehensible beeping and is even able to tell the difference between its emotions through its beeping.[21]
    According to Ulysses, the Courier has been to Circle Junction, New Reno, Vault City, Fort Abandon, and on Brahmin drives at the Big Circle.[1]
    The Courier has very limited knowledge of the Midwest, as when ED-E from the Divide plays the log from when a child found it, asking it where that occurred will have ED-E respond with Chicago, Illinois. The Courier knows about Illinois if they have met the Mojave ED-E ("Illinois? So that's where you got that plate. The other you, I mean."),[22] but is unaware of it if they have not ("Illin-what? Come on you're making that name up.").[23] Regardless of if they have met the Mojave ED-E, the Courier does not know about Chicago, asking "What's a Chicago?"[24]
    Upon hearing that the Lonesome Drifter is from Montana, a male Courier with the Lady Killer perk can ask if he is 17, and then express relief when he says he is 28.[25]
    An intelligent Courier can recognize that Ulysses took his name from Ulysses S. Grant, not the mythological figure.[26]
    In dialogue with Keith, the Courier states they have "run some cons in my day."[27]

    Notes

    In the opening cutscene, the Courier can be briefly seen wearing a recolored version of the Caravaneer Outfit with a light-colored Cowboy Hat.
    In one of the endings for Dead Money, the Courier becomes trapped within the Sierra Madre Vault. This results in a game over slide.
    The Courier was shown wearing an Armored Vault 21 Jumpsuit during Fallout: New Vegas previews and in the ending. However, this item does not appear in-game, and can only be obtained using console commands.
    One of the ending slides in Lonesome Road shows the Courier wearing the "Yes Man" variant of the Courier Duster. This will happen no matter which side was nuked, or even if the nukes were stopped.
    The Courier is one of two protagonists throughout the main Fallout series to not begin their adventure by leaving a Vault. The other protagonist is the Chosen One from Fallout 2.
    As mentioned by Father Elijah on his radio frequency in Dead Money, the Courier carries Collar 21, assuming the Courier had stolen a Pip-Boy from a Vault 21 dweller.[28][29]

Appearances

The Courier is the player character of Fallout: New Vegas. They are also mentioned in the graphic novel, All Roads.
Behind the Scenes

    Originally, players would have been able to select from three different playable races for the Courier during Character Creation. Obsidian had planned to include both ghouls and super mutants, however, Bethesda strongly advised against doing so on the basis that armor and weapons would need to be reworked for each race. Obsidian followed Bethesda's advice and left the Courier human.[Pub 1]
    The Courier is the Joker in the deck of Vault Playing Cards included with the Collector's Edition of Fallout: New Vegas.
    Josh Sawyer stated that the developers had "intentionally left the Courier's origins and the exact nature of the initial transaction vague" except that they had carried their "delivery from southern NCR, toward the Hub."[Dev 1]
    According to Chris Avellone, the story of the Divide began with the NCR finding Enclave technology, recognizing symbols which matched a different location, and subsequently hiring the Courier to take it there.[Dev 2]
